# Kiddy's
Kiddy's is a children's clothing store that uses organic cotton to guarantee the highest quality. Because our designs are distinctive, parents participate in the creation process. Our unique blend of materials, designs, and colours is what makes us who we are.

## User Experience (UX)
### Site Structure
Kiddy's website has four pages. The **home page** is default loading page, **about**, **shop** and **contact** pages are all accessible primarily from the navigation menu.
### Design Choices
 * #### Typography
   The fonts chosen were 'Oswald' for the heading and 'Lato' for the body text.
         * 'Oswald' was chosen for the heading to give the user an intal good feel.
         * 'Lato' is used for the body text because it easy to read for all.
 * #### Colour Scheme 
   The colour scheme eventually chosen is one based on black and white. The colour contrasts with the cotton colour which is the main materials in my industry.
