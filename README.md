## Design Choices

 * ### Typography
      The fonts chosen were 'Oswald' for the heading and 'Lato' for the body text.
     * 'Oswald' was chosen for the heading to give the user an intal good feel.
      * 'Lato' is used for the body text because it easy to read for all.
 * ### Colour Scheme 
      The colour scheme eventually chosen is one based on black and white. The colour contrasts with the cotton colour which is the main materials in my industry.
