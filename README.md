## User Experience (UX)
### Site Structure
Kiddy's website has four pages. The **home page** is default loading page, **about**, **shop** and **contact** pages are all accessible primarily from the navigation menu.
### Design Choices
 * #### Typography
   The fonts chosen were 'Oswald' for the heading and 'Lato' for the body text.
         * 'Oswald' was chosen for the heading to give the user an intal good feel.
         * 'Lato' is used for the body text because it easy to read for all.
 * #### Colour Scheme 
   The colour scheme eventually chosen is one based on black and white. The colour contrasts with the cotton colour which is the main materials in my industry.
